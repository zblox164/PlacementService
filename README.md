# Placement Service

## THIS MODULE MAY NOT WORK AS INTENDED. IT HAS BEEN OVER 2 YEARS SINCE THE LAST UPDATE AND I DO NOT KNOW WHEN I'LL BE ABLE TO UPDATE IT. THIS MODULE HAS NOT BEEN FORGOTTEN, JUST TEMPORARILY OUT OF DEVELOPMENT. I HOPE TO RETURN SOON TO THIS PROJECT

This module was developed using and intended for Roblox Studio

NOTE: Was originally named "Placement Module V3". This module no longer goes by that name.

This module is the first iteration out of three modules to be object oriented making it even more powerful. It is also the **easiest** published placement system kit on the Roblox platform! 

## Benefits

- **It's Easy to Learn.** 
Placement Service was designed with beginner programmers in mind. It only requires beginner Luau scripting to get the system up and working while still maintaining a strong feature set for those who like to tinker! *It removes the hassle of creating a complex system of your own.*

- **It's Polished and Reliable.** 
Over the period that Placement Service has been in development, I've had time to test and polish every feature included!

- **Regularly Updated.** 
Placement Service is always being updated with bugs fixes, performance improvements, and feature updates!

- **It's Secure.** 
Placement Service is fully filtering enabled compatible to make secure gameplay easy for all of your players!

- **It's Highly Customizable.** 
Placement Service is packed with features so that you can make a placement system that is perfect for your game! Don't want interpolation? Don't want a grid system? Changing these is as simple as unchecking a checkbox!
